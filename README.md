This is my solution for a task I was given when applying for an intern position
at RabIT SE.

To try the project you should clone the repository to a folder which your
webserver serves and fill in the database configuration in model\config.php.

You should probably create a blank database in MySQL and use that, since the
scripts will create the tables needed for the project with some sample data
inserted automatically (so that the pages won't be empty).
